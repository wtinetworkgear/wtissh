# WTI SSH - Random command test

These are "Hello World" Python programs on how to talk to WTI devices with an SSH session.

These `SSH script` Python scripts will work on any modern WTI device, the commands being used are universal on all WTI OOB and PDU type devices making it the perfect starting point to start learning and experimenting with the SSH CLI interface

The prefered way to interact with WTI units is via the API:
https://www.wti.com/t-wti-restful-api-download.aspx

The API method is a much more robust/future forward way to interact with WTI devices, but as a way to cover all the bases, we have included these sample Python scripts to interact with the WTI SSH shell.

# To Configure Python Script:

Required: 
paramiko is required, issue `pip install paramiko` if not done already

Have a text file in same directory as this program named  `terminal_devices.txt` with all devices to test, formatted like this:

192.168.0.1 username password  
192.168.0.2 username password


Run the program from CLI and select y to save the file, a log file will be saved in an outputs folder, created automatically in the current directory.

Program runs at a rate of about 10 seconds per address, changing that will likely result in failed output. 

For large groups of devices, ensure the readme is updating with data as the program runs. 


# To Run with Python:
`python wtissh.py`
